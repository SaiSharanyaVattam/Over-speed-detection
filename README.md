The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an intelligent speed detection system that can effectively measure the speed of vehicles on roads or highways. By accurately detecting instances of over-speeding, this system can help authorities enforce traffic regulations and take necessary actions to prevent accidents and ensure compliance with speed limits. The project  uses lasers for the detection of over speed. Our circuit consists of two LDRs which are always pointed with the light of lasers and gets disturbed when a vehicle travels on the road , the time elapsed between the disturbance of first LDR and second LDR is used for the calculation of speed with which the vehicle travelled and alerts if the speed crosses limit.
